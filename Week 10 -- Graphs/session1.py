# Problem 1: There and Back

"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

   Q1: Should we handle the case where the flights list is empty?
   Q2: Are we guaranteed that all flight destinations referenced in the adjacency list are valid indices?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to check if every flight connection is bidirectional. For each node u and each
   destination v in flights[u], I need to verify that there's also a flight back from v to u.
   I'll iterate through all nodes and their destinations, checking if the reverse connection exists.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   For each node u and each destination v in flights[u]
   Check if u exists in flights[v]
   Return False if any reverse connection is missing

   for u in range(length of flights) do
       for v in flights[u] do
           if u not in flights[v] then
               return False
   return True

# Problem 2: Find Center of Airport

   Q1: Are we guaranteed that the input represents a valid star graph?
   Q2: What should we return if there are fewer than 2 terminals?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to find the center node of a star graph. In a star graph, the center node
   appears in every edge. I can check the first two edges - the center must be the
   common node between them. I'll compare the first edge with any other edge to
   find which node appears in both.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Take first two edges
   Find common node between them
   Return the common node

   if length of terminals < 2 then
       return -1
   u, v <- terminals[0]
   return u if u in terminals[1] else v

# Problem 3: Finding All Reachable Destinations

   Q1: Should we include the starting location in the result?
   Q2: How do we handle destinations that don't exist in the flights dictionary?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to find all reachable destinations using BFS to ensure I visit nodes in order
   of increasing distance (layovers). I'll use a queue starting with the start location,
   and for each location I visit, I'll add its unvisited neighbors to the queue.
   I'll track visited locations to avoid cycles.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Use BFS with queue starting from start location
   Track visited locations to avoid cycles
   Add reachable neighbors to queue

   queue <- deque with start
   result <- empty list

   Q2: How should we handle cycles in the graph during DFS?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to find all reachable destinations using DFS. I'll use recursion to explore
   as deep as possible before backtracking. I'll maintain a visited set to avoid cycles
   and add destinations to the result list in the order they're first visited.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Add current location to result when first visited

# Problem 5: Find Itinerary

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to find the complete itinerary by following the flight connections. I'll build
   a mapping from source to destination airports, then find the starting airport (appears
