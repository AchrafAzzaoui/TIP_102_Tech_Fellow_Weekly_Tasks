# Problem 1: Croquembouche II

1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

   Q1: Should we return empty list if the design tree is empty?
   Q2: Do we need to handle the case where nodes have None values?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree and return the result
   as a list of lists, where each inner list represents one level of the tree.
   I'll use a queue to process nodes level by level, keeping track of how many nodes
   are in each level so I can group them properly.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Use BFS with queue to traverse level by level
   For each level, process all nodes and collect their values
   Add children to queue for next level

   queue <- deque with root
   result <- empty list
   while queue is not empty do
       current_level <- empty list
       level_size <- length of queue
       for i in range(level_size) do
           node <- queue.popleft()
           add node.val to current_level
           if node.left exists, add to queue
           if node.right exists, add to queue
       add current_level to result
   return result

# Problem 2: Icing Cupcakes in Zigzag Order

"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

   Q1: Should we alternate direction starting from left-to-right or right-to-left?
   Q2: How do we handle None nodes in the zigzag pattern?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to traverse the tree level by level but alternate the direction for each level.
   I'll use a deque that allows me to add and remove from both ends. For left-to-right levels,
   I'll use normal queue operations. For right-to-left levels, I'll use stack-like operations
   and reverse the order of adding children.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Use deque with alternating direction flag
   For each level, process nodes in current direction
   Add children in appropriate order for next level

   queue <- deque with root
   result <- empty list
   on_reverse_level <- True
   while queue is not empty do
       on_reverse_level <- not on_reverse_level
       for each node in current level do
           if on_reverse_level then
               node <- queue.pop() (from right)
               add children right-to-left to front of queue
           else
               node <- queue.popleft() (from left)

# Problem 3: Larger Order Tree

"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

   Q1: Should we modify the tree in place or create a new tree?
   Q2: Do we need to maintain the BST property after transformation?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to transform each node's value to be the sum of its original value plus all
   values greater than it in the BST. Since this is a BST, I can use reverse in-order
   traversal (right-root-left) to visit nodes in descending order. I'll maintain a
   running sum and update each node as I visit it.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Use reverse in-order traversal with running sum
   Visit right subtree, then current node, then left subtree
   Update each node with cumulative sum

   curr_sum <- 0

       if not root then return
       dfs(root.right)

1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

   Q1: What should we return if the target order is not found in the tree?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to find the next node in the same level as the target order using level-order
   traversal. I'll process the tree level by level, and when I find the target node,
   I'll return the next node in the queue if it exists and is on the same level.

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to add a new row of nodes at a specific depth. If depth is 1, I'll create
   a new root with the original tree as its left child. Otherwise, I'll use BFS to
   reach depth-1, then for each node at that level, I'll insert new nodes with the
   specified flavor and reconnect the original children appropriately.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Handle special case for depth 1
   Use BFS to reach target depth - 1
   Insert new nodes and reconnect children

   if depth == 1 then
       create new root with original tree as left child
       return new root
   
   use BFS to reach depth - 1
   for each node at depth - 1 do
