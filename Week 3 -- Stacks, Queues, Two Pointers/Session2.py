# QUESTION 1: Blueprint Approval Process
"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

    Q1: Can the blueprint complexities have duplicates?
    Q2: Is it guaranteed that all inputs are integers?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:

    I will simulate the blueprint approval process by inserting all blueprint
    complexity values into a min-heap so that simpler blueprints are always processed first.
    Iâ€™ll then pop from the heap and add each to the result list in sorted order.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

    Subproblem 1: Insert all blueprint complexities into a heap
        for blueprint in blueprints:
            insert blueprint into heap

    Subproblem 2: Pop from heap into result list
        while heap is not empty:
            pop min blueprint and append to result list

4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

    heap = []

# QUESTION 2: Build the Tallest Skyscraper
"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

    Q1: Can multiple skyscrapers be started consecutively if the condition fails repeatedly?
    Q2: Do floor heights include duplicates or negative values?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:

    I will iterate through the floor heights, simulating the stacking process.
    If the next floor can't be stacked due to being taller than the current top,
    I will start a new skyscraper and clear the stack.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

    Subproblem 1: Traverse each floor height
        for floor in floors:
            if floor can't be stacked on current:
                increment skyscraper count
                reset stack
            push floor to stack

4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

            stack.clear()
        stack.append(floor_h)
    return num_skyscrapers


# QUESTION 3: Dream Corridor Design
"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

    Q1: Can the two chosen segments be adjacent or must they be separated?
    Q2: Is the goal always to maximize the product of distance and min segment height?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:

    I will use the two-pointer technique. At each step, calculate the area
    between the segments at the pointers. I will keep the larger segment
    and move the pointer pointing to the smaller one inward.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

    Subproblem 1: Initialize pointers and max_area
        left <- 0, right <- len(segments) - 1, max_area <- 0

    Subproblem 2: Compare area and move pointer
        while left < right:
            area <- (right - left) * min(segments[left], segments[right])
            max_area <- max(max_area, area)

                left += 1

# QUESTION 4: Dream Building Layout
"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

    Q1: Is the input always balanced in number of '[' and ']'?
    Q2: Do we need to output the balanced string or just count the swaps?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:

    I will track the balance of brackets while scanning the string.
    If the balance ever dips negative, I track the minimum imbalance.
    The number of swaps needed is the ceiling of half the absolute minimum imbalance.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

    Subproblem 1: Track balance and min_balance
        balance <- 0, min_balance <- 0
        for char in s:

# QUESTION 5: Designing a Balanced Room
"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

    Q1: Are all non-parenthesis characters guaranteed to be lowercase letters?
    Q2: Are we allowed to return any valid balanced string, or must it be the lexicographically smallest?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do:

    I will use a stack to track unmatched '(' characters and a set to store invalid ')' positions.
    After scanning the string, I will remove all unmatched indices from the original string.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

    Subproblem 1: Identify unmatched parentheses
