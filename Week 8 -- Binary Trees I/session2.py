# Problem 1: Sorting Plants by Rarity

"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

   Q1: Should we return the plants sorted by their key values or by their names?
   Q2: What should we return if the collection is empty?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to perform an in-order traversal of a binary search tree to get the plants
   sorted by their rarity (key values). I'll use recursion to traverse the left subtree,
   visit the current node, then traverse the right subtree. This will give me the
   plants in sorted order since BST in-order traversal visits nodes in ascending order.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Base case: If collection is empty, return empty list
   Recursive case: Traverse left + current node + traverse right

   if not collection then
       return []
   else
       return sort_plants(collection.left) + [(collection.key, collection.val)] + sort_plants(collection.right)

4. Translate the pseudocode into Python and share your final answer:

   def sort_plants(collection):
       if not collection:
           return []
       else:
           return sort_plants(collection.left) + [(collection.key, collection.val)] + sort_plants(collection.right)

# Problem 2: Finding Flowers

"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

   Q1: Is the inventory guaranteed to be a binary search tree?
   Q2: Should the search be case-sensitive?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to search for a specific flower name in a binary search tree using recursion.
   My base case will be when the inventory is empty (return False) or when I find the target.
   For the recursive case, I'll compare the target name with the current node's value
   and search the appropriate subtree based on the comparison.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Base case: If inventory is empty, return False
   Recursive case: Compare name with current value and search appropriate subtree

   if not inventory then
       return False
   if name < inventory.val then
       return find_flower(inventory.left, name)
   elif name > inventory.val then

# Problem 3: Adding a New Plant to the Collection

"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

   Q1: Should we maintain the BST property when inserting?
   Q2: What should we do if the plant name already exists in the collection?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to add a new plant to a binary search tree while maintaining the BST property.
   My base case will be when I reach an empty spot (create a new node).
   For the recursive case, I'll compare the new name with the current node's value
   and recursively insert into the appropriate subtree, then return the current node.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Base case: If collection is empty, create new TreeNode
   Recursive case: Compare name and insert into appropriate subtree

   if not collection then

# Problem 4: Remove Plant

"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

   Q1: How should we handle the case where a node has two children?
   Q2: Should we maintain the BST property after removal?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to remove a plant from a binary search tree while maintaining the BST property.
   My base case will be when the collection is empty (return None).
   For the recursive case, I'll find the target node and handle three scenarios:
   1) Node has no children - simply remove it
   2) Node has one child - replace with that child
   3) Node has two children - replace with in-order predecessor and remove that node

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Base case: If collection is empty, return None
   Search cases: Recursively search left or right based on comparison
   Removal cases: Handle 0, 1, or 2 children scenarios

   if not collection then
       return None
   elif name < collection.val then
       collection.left <- remove_plant(collection.left, name)

# Problem 5: Find Most Common Plants in Collection

"""
1. Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:

   Q1: Should we return all plants that tie for the highest frequency?
   Q2: What should we return if the tree is empty?

2. Write out in plain English what you want to do: 

   I want to find all plants that appear most frequently in the tree.
   I'll use a depth-first search to traverse the entire tree and count the frequency
   of each plant using a dictionary. I'll also track the maximum frequency seen.
   After the traversal, I'll return all plants that have the maximum frequency.

3. Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:

   Create frequency map and track max frequency
   Use DFS to count all occurrences
   Return all plants with max frequency

   freq_map <- empty dictionary
   max_freq <- -1
   function dfs(root):
       if not root then return
       increment freq_map[root.val]
       update max_freq
       dfs(root.left)
       dfs(root.right)
